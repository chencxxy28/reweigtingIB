There are three files in the repository. The first one "causal_glm_updated_submission.R" simulates the information integration under the logistic regression setting. Details of the simulation can be found in the book chapter, "Advancing Information Integration through Empirical Likelihood: Selective Reviews and a New Idea". This code provides results in Table 2.

The second and third files "glm gim.R", and "Emp_LL_IB_GLM.R" provide the simulation calculation for Table 1. Where "glm gim.R" provides the results for IB_GIM in Table 1, and Emp_LL_IB_GLM.R provides the simulation results for IB_New and GLM in Table 1. The code in "glm gim.R" is suitable for parallel computing. You may adapt it to your parallel computing server or the HPC.
